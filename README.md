# TL-Events Source Code

While you might want to run this bot yourselves. Please note there are some files that haven't been uploaded for security and privacy reasons.

## What are the folders?
- commands
  - The commands folder is where each of the commands are seperated into their categories
- discordEvents
  - There are two events for the bot that require running scripts and having them in their own files allows for keeping the main file smaller
- serices 
  - Serives are systems that are either called one and run for the whole duration of the bot being online or stay running for an extnded period (like gift spawning)
 
## Can you help me with setting this up?
Sadly I will not be helping people with getting this bot online and running.
