# TL-Events Source Code

While you might want to run this bot yourselves. Please note there are some files that haven't been uploaded for security and privacy reasons.

## What is TL Events?
TL Events is a discord bot that was created for running discord events on TheLoungeMC's Discord server. Each event runs for the duration of a month and relates to one of the following events, Easter, Halloween or Christmas. The bot was originally going to be used as a one off event but due to the success of the bot for Christmas 2020 it was brought back for Easter 2021 and hopefully Halloween 2021.

Each version of the bot plans to improve on past systems used in the previous events until the version that people enjoy the most is created. I hope you enjoy viewing the source code to find any secrets that are hidden within. 

## Can you help me with setting this up?
Sadly I will not be helping people with getting this bot online and running.
